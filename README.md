project
=======

A very basic project template. Clone into whatever you want to call your new project.

A few things to keep in mind:

* Make sure you have php 5.4  
    ```bash
    $ php -v
    ```
* Install gulp globally 
    ```bash
    $ which gulp
    $ npm install -g gulp
    ```
* Install node packages  
    ```bash
    $ npm install
    ```
* Start web server  
    ```bash
    $ php -S localhost:{port} -t public/
    ```
* In a new terminal tab, run the gulp watch command  
    ```bash
    $ gulp watch
    ```
