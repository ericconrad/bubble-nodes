project
=======

A very basic project template. Clone into whatever you want to call your new project.

A few things to keep in mind:

* Make sure you have php 5.4  
    ```
    $ php -v
    ```
* Install gulp globally `$ which gulp` if not, `$ npm install -g gulp`
* Install node packages `$ npm install`
* Start web server `$ cd public && php -S http://localhost:{port}
