project
=======

A very basic project template. Requirements: node, npm, php 5.4+

* Clone into whatever you want to call your new project, e.g. "banana-bot"  
    ```
    $ git clone git@github.com:johnshopkins/project.git banana-bot
    ```  

* cd into your new project directory  
    ```
    $ cd banana-bot
    ```  

* Install gulp globally, if you don't already have it  
    ```
    $ which gulp || npm install -g gulp
    ```  

* Install node packages  
    ```
    $ npm install
    ```  

* Start web server on your favorite port, e.g. 4000
    ```
    $ php -S localhost:4000 -t public/
    ```  

* In a new terminal tab, run the gulp watch command  
    ```
    $ gulp watch
    ```  
    
* Open to http://localhost:4000 in your favorite browser

* Scoop up the mountains of money and awards and medals bestowed upon your head on account of your new and great success.
